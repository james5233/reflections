Creating a remote repository is helpful when the multiple people are working
on a project or when one needs access to the repository from multiple 
devices which may or may not belong to us. The latter may be true in case 
one has to work while they are travelling.

Manual push and pull to or from a remote repository is preferred over an 
automatic setup which triggers update on specific events, say a commit,
because of the same reasons why manual commits in git are preferred over
an automatic system of version control - flexibility, freedom, and
robustness.
