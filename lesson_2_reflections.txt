When I initialize a repository, git looks around fro files in the directory
and collects and stores some data about them. This may be required because
of the way git works. What I mean is that I have seen similar behaviour
with may other programs and libraries where one need to initialize a 
data-structure or a library before being able to use it. My guess is that
necessary book-keeping tasks which cannot be logically clubbed with other
git actions like commit etc. are carried out in the initialization stage.

The staging area allows for a logical separation between the working
directory and a repository. So, whatever one puts in the working directory
need not automatically be included in the repository. Adding a step between
the working dir and the repository makes the commit process simpler, while
moving the necessary complexity to the staging area.
